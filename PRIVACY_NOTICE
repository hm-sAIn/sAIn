### Processing
sAIn further processes the user's moving image material on his device to so-called keypoints. From this point on, the data sAIn works with is considered anonymized and cannot be traced back to the original moving image material. 

### Use

### Sending data to third parties
sAIn does not send any data to third parties, all data remains locally on the user's device. Data that is regularly required for communication with the communication partner is only transmitted to this partner.
